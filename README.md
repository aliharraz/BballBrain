# File Upload Service

File management project using Spring Boot for file download, storage, and metadata retrieval.

## Introduction

This project implements a file upload service using Spring Boot. It allows users to upload files, which are stored on the server's file system. Metadata about each uploaded file is stored in a database for easy retrieval and management.

## Features

- **File Upload:** Allows users to upload files.
- **File Storage:** Stores uploaded files on the server's file system.
- **Metadata Storage:** Stores metadata (such as filename, content type, size, and upload timestamp) in a database.
- **File Retrieval:** Provides endpoints to retrieve files and their metadata.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** Application framework used to build the service.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Used for database operations and managing file metadata.
- **Postgresql:** In-memory database used for storing file metadata (can be easily replaced with other databases like MySQL,etc.).
- **Spring Web:** Used for handling HTTP requests.
- **Spring Test:** Used for testing the Spring components.
